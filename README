Net::OAI::Harvester
-------------------

Net::OAI::Harvester is a Perl library for interacting with OAI-PMH repositories.
OAI-PMH stands for Open Archives Intitiatve Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.
More about OAI-PMH can be found at http://www.openarchives.org.

INSTALLATION

You *must* be connected to the Internet to run the test suite.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

DEPENDENCIES

OAI-PMH is essentially XML over HTTP so rather than reinvent the wheel there
are a few dependencies.

LWP::UserAgent - for HTTP 
XML::SAX - for XML parsing
URI - for url representation
YAML - for object serialization

You also probably should be using Perl 5.8.0 at least since many repositories 
contain UTF8 data.
